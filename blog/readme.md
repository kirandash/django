# Blog with Django and React
## 1. Intro
### 1.1 What we will learn
1. **React**: 
    - Client side
    - Helps with User interaction
    - Built with JS Programming language
2. **Django**:
    - Server Side
    - Persistence
    - Built with Python
3. **Django REST Framework**
    - Sending data to/from client and server
    - Python

**Topics**:
1. Intro to React and Django
2. Django and REST implementation
3. React: Displaying and editing data
4. Authorizing and Routing

### 1.2 Prerequisites
1. HTML
2. JS
3. Python
4. Web/HTTP

## 2. Django and React
### 2.1 Django Intro
1. Web Development framework
2. Built with Python
3. Helps us build websites quickly
4. **Components**:
    - MTV (Model, Template, View)
    - **Model**: Python class used to store data in DB
    - **View**: Component that handles request from browser. Gets request from browser ---> Retrieves data from DB ---> perform any logic if reqd ---> and then send the data to the template which can then be viewed on browser
    - **Template**: Display data received from view in HTML
    - **url conf**: urls.py file maps a particular url in browser with a view in django
    - **Flow**: Client Browser(React) ---> HTTP ---> Django Server ---> urls.py ---> views.py <---> Model ---> Template ---> Client Browser

### 2.2 React Intro
1. JS based Web Development framework
2. Helps building Rich Internet applications
3. Client side Framework
4. Components in React: View
5. Redux for handling data
6. Thunks for handling API calls
7. Selectors: another layer between Redux and Thunks
8. Styled Components: For better styling
9. For communicating with Django: we will use **Django REST Framework** to make API calls.

## 3. Setting up Django Project
### 3.1 Install Python
1. **Python**: https://www.python.org/downloads/. Current version: 3.8.2. 
    - Python 3.x includes **venv** for project environment.
    - Python 2.x uses **virtualenv** for project environment.
2. Download the .pkg file and run installation. Or use brew: `brew install python3`. Brew: https://brew.sh/
3. Check the version by typing `python3 --version`. (Python 3.8.2)
5. Python3 installs pip3 script to mac automatically.

### 3.2 Creating a Project Environment
1. Create a virtual environment for project using venv tool from Python3:
    - `mkdir blog`, `cd blog`, `mkdir backend`, `mkdir frontend`, `cd backend`
    - `python3 -m venv blog_env`. Will create `blog_env` venv folder for us inside backend directory. Add blog_env to gitignore list
2. **Understanding venv folder structure**: `blog_env`
    - **bin/ Folder**: contains scripts to interact with dedicated executables eg: python, pip etc. Which means any command we run here: will only run in the venv instead of the system wide python. Also includes a file activate, which is used to activate our venv. 
        - **Activate Virtual environment**: Run: `. blog_env/bin/activate` or `source blog_env/bin/activate`. This will now launch the command line from venv. Can be identified as terminal starts with `(blog_env)`. So now: python and pip command will run from the virtual environment. Ex: Run `python --version`: will return Python 3.8.2. If we run `python --version` in any other terminal, it will return Python 2.7.16 which is our global python installation. Globally we will have to run `python3 --version` to get python3 details.
        - Similary if we run pip from venv to install any package, the package will be installed in venv only instead of system wide.
        - **Deactivate venv**: Run `deactivate`. Now terminal will not show `(blog_env)` anymore.
    - **include/ Folder**: used to look up installed packages in our environments.
        - Run: `pip list` in venv to check list of packages installed: will return pip, setuptools: the default packages in venv
        - To check system wide packages, run: `pip list` outside of venv. The list should show more packages installed system wide.
    - **lib/ Folder** used to look up installed packages in our environments.
    - **pyvenv.cfg File**: To configure venv.

### 3.3 Install Django & Create Django Project
1. **Activate venv**: `. blog_env/bin/activate`
2. Check the terminal should prompt `(blog_env)` in the beginning.
3. **Install Django**: https://www.djangoproject.com/download/. Current version: 3.0.6
    - `pip install django` (will install django 3.0.6 and pytz library which provides timezone support). Note this will be installed in venv and not systemwide.
    - It will install all the python code and also adds a script in bin directory called `django-admin` which we can use to run django related commands.
6. **Create django project**: Run `django-admin startproject blog`
7. Rename the project folder to `src` or any other name viz `blog_project` to confusion with same root app name `blog`.
